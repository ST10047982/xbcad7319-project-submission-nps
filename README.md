# Denisha Pather Physiotherapy App

## Introduction

This project is being developed for a physiotherapy practice called Denisha Pather Physiotherapy owned by Denisha Pather, who we will be working with. This practice currently works with and relies on manual processes for managing their patient’s intake forms and scheduling these appointments, which can be time-consuming, cause delays, or have issues due to human errors such as double bookings and missed appointments. We have been tasked by the practice to modernize and streamline these operations by developing a custom Android application to digitalize the patient forms and appointment bookings. The app will offer the following functionality: booking, rescheduling, reminding, and canceling appointments effectively on real-time availability and filling out forms efficiently and effectively.

## Our Solution to the Problem

### Functional Requirements
- Patients must be able to register by providing basic information such as their name, surname, email, username, password, medical aid, medical aid number, and phone number.
- Both patients and staff must be able to log in using their usernames and passwords, with staff login information pre-set in the database for easy access.
- Patients must be able to view available appointment slots and book, reschedule, or cancel their appointments.
- Patients will be able to fill out and submit intake forms that capture personal details and medical history before their appointments.
- Patients will not be able to book an appointment unless the forms have been filled out.
- Patients should be able to attach any test results they receive, such as x-rays.
- Patients must be able to view and update their personal information and medical history at any time by accessing their profile in the app.
